# Tiny Logistic-Regression Demoâ€ƒðŸ“ˆðŸ¤–

A **five-minute, first-principles exercise** that demystifies model training:

* We synthesise two little clusters of 2-D points  
  * **Class 0** â€“ roughly around **(0, 0)**  
  * **Class 1** â€“ roughly around **(5, 5)**
* A streaming (online) **logistic regression** watches the data 10 times
* After each pass it prints accuracy and at the end, plots the learning curve

The aim is to _see_ the model adjust its weights and minimise errors - no magic, just gradient steps!
